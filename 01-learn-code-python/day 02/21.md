# F-strings in Python

Ever played Pokemon and chosen a funny name so that the in-game messages would come out funny?

In Python we can create strings that contain dynamic values with the [f-string](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals) syntax.

```py
num_bananas = 10
print(f"You have {num_bananas} bananas")
# You have 10 bananas
```

- Opening quotes must be preceded by an `f`.
- Variables within curly brackets have their values "interpolated" (injected) into the string.

## Assignment

Fix the bug on line 7. Use an f-string to inject the dynamic values into the string:

- Replace `NAME` with the value of the `name` variable
- Replace `RACE` with the value of the `race` variable
- Replace `AGE` with the value of the `age` variable

Do _not_ "hard-code" the values into the string. For example, this is _not_ the solution we're looking for (even though it happens to work in this case):

```py
print("Yarl is a dwarf who is 37 years old.")
```

We need the player to see _their_ values.

## Tip

**Punctuation matters!** Make sure your output matches the expected output exactly.


```
name = "Yarl"
age = 37
race = "dwarf"

# Don't edit above this line

print(f"{name} is a {race} who is {age} years old.")
```
