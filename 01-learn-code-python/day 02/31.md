# Character Report

One of our interns started working on a program that outputs data about Fantasy Quest player characters. It's nearly done but has various bugs.

## Assignment

Fix the bugs and get the character report working!

1. Update the variables to their expected data types:

- `level`: `integer`
- `name`: `string`
- `character_class`: `string`
- `account_active`: `boolean`
- `pvp_rank`: `string`
- `max_health`: `integer`
- `max_mana`: `integer`
- `armor`: `integer`
- `magic_resistance`: `float`

2. Fix the bugs with the f-strings on lines 12 and 13.

## Original Values

```py
level = "25"
name = "Lopen"
character_class = "Windrunner"
account_active = "True"
pvp_rank = Squire
max_health = 79
max_mana = 274
armor = 12.0
magic_resistance = 15.4
```


```py
level = 25
name = "Lopen"
character_class = "Windrunner"
account_active = True
pvp_rank = "Squire"
max_health = 79
max_mana = 274
armor = 12
magic_resistance = 15.4

print("Character Report")
print(f"{name} is a level {level} {character_class}, ranked as a {pvp_rank}.")
print(f"They have {max_health} max health and {max_mana} max mana.")
print(f"They have {armor} armor and {magic_resistance} magic resistance.")
print(f"Their account is currently active: {account_active}")

# Don't edit below this line

print("Character Report Complete")
print(
    f"Data types {type(level)}, {type(name)}, {type(character_class)}, {type(account_active)}, {type(pvp_rank)}, {type(max_health)}, {type(max_mana)}, {type(armor)}, {type(magic_resistance)}"
)

```
