# NoneType Variables

Not all variables have a value. We can make an "empty" variable by setting it to [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None). `None` is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value. It is _not_ the same as zero, False, or an empty string.

```py
my_mental_acuity = None
```

The value of `my_mental_acuity` in this case is `None` until we use the assignment operator, `=`, to give it a value.

## None is NOT a string

[NoneType](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.NoneType) is _not_ the same as a string with a value of "None":

```py
my_none = None # this is a None-type
my_none = "None" # this is a string with the value "None"
```

## Assignment

Declare a variable named `enemy` and set it to `None`. Don't change the `print()` function.
