# Storing Results

Now that we know how to store and change the value of variables let's do some math!

Here are some examples of common mathematical operators in Python syntax.

```py
sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b
```

Parentheses can be used to [order math operations](https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html).

```py
avg = (a + b + c) / 3
```
