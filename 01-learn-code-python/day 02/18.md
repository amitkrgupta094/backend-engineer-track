# Variable Names

Variable names can _not_ have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.

The creator of the Python language himself, [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), [implores us](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) to use `snake_case` for variable names. What _is_ snake case? It's just a style for writing variable names. Here are some examples of different casing styles:

| Name | Code | Language(s) that recommend it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Snake Case | `my_hero_health` | Python, Ruby, Rust |
| Camel Case | `myHeroHealth` | JavaScript, Java |
| Pascal Case | `MyHeroHealth` | C#, C++ |
| No Casing | `myherohealth` | No one: don't do this |

To be clear, your Python code will still _work_ with Camel Case or Pascal Case, but can we please just have nice things? We just want some consistency in our craft.

If you won't use snake case for _you_, do it for _me_. I beg you.

Which is valid camel case?



hero_health


heroHealth (ticked)
