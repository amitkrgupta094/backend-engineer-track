# Variables Vary

Variables are called "variables" because they can hold any value and that value can change (it varies).

For example, this code prints `20`:

```py
acceleration = 10
acceleration = 20
print(acceleration)
```

![Copy icon](/img/copy_icon.svg)

The line `acceleration = 20` _reassigns_ the value of `acceleration` to 20. It _overwrites_ whatever was being held in the `acceleration` variable before (10 in this case).

## Assignment

We need to reduce our hero's health as they take damage.

Before each `print()` function in the provided code, change the value of `player_health` to 100 _less_ than it was before.

The final output should look like this:

```
900
800
700
600
```



```
player_health = 1000

# reduce by 100 here

player_health = player_health - 100;
print(player_health)

# and here
player_health = player_health - 100;

print(player_health)


# and here
player_health = player_health - 100;

print(player_health)

# and here
player_health = player_health - 100;


print(player_health)
```
