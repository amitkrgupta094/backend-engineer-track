# Negative Numbers

Negative numbers in Python work the way you probably expect. Just add a minus sign:

```py
my_negative_num = -1
```

## Assignment

When our hero walks through poison, their health should go down. Right now the hero is _gaining_ `10` health instead of _losing_ `10` health. Change the `poison_damage` variable to be negative.



```
player_health = 100
poison_damage = -10

# don't touch below this line

player_poison_health = player_health + poison_damage

print(player_poison_health)
```
