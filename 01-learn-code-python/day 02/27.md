# Multi-Variable Declaration

We can save space when creating many new variables by declaring them on the same line:

```py
sword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = "Excalibur", 10, 200
```

![Copy icon](/img/copy_icon.svg)

Which is the same as:

```py
sword_name = "Excalibur"
sword_damage = 10
sword_length = 200
```

![Copy icon](/img/copy_icon.svg)

Any number of variables can be declared on the same line, and variables declared on the same line _should_ be related to one another in some way so that the code remains easy to understand.

We call code that's easy to understand "clean code".
