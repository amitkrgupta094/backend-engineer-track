# Fix Your First Bug

The combat system in Fantasy Quest isn't working as intended! It appears that players are _gaining_ health when attacked instead of _losing_ it.

## Assignment

Fix the math bug on line 3.


```
sword_damage = 10
player_health = 100
health_after_attack = player_health - sword_damage

# Don't touch below this line
print(f"Lollilfred's health is: {player_health}")
print(f"Lollilfred is hit by a sword for {sword_damage} damage...")
print(f"Lollilfred's health is now: {health_after_attack}")
```
